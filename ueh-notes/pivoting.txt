Dynamic Port Forwarding:
My machine ip: 192.168.29.210
Windows machine ip: 192.168.29.190 

ssh -D 9050 192.168.29.190 
So all the traffic coming to 192.168.29.210:9050 will be forwarded to the windows machine.

Now got to firefox proxy settings and set Socks4 proxy as below.
IP - 127.0.0.1
Port - 9050
Here we are forwarding all traffic to port 9050.
So all the traffic coming to our port 9050 will be forwarded to the windows machine which will then reach the destination address.

Pivoting with proxychains using nmap:
My machine ip: 192.168.29.210
Windows machine ip: 192.168.29.190, 192.168.126.121
Metasploitable ip: 192.168.126.129

proxychains nmap -p21,80,22 192.168.126.129
With this cmd we can pivot and scan the metasploitable machine.
