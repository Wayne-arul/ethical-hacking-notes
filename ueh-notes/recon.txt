Enumeration & Scanning:

Host command:
host google.com
The above command tells us the details about the domain.
Details include ipaddr, mail server, dns server etc.

host -t a google.com
The above command gives us the ipv4 address.
A records shows ipv4.

host -t aaaa google.com
The above command gives us the ipv6 address.
AAAA records shows ipv6.

host -t ns google.com
The above command shows us the name servers of domain.
So if one dns server gets down, it will copy data to another dns server.This process is called as zone transfer.

host -l zonetransfer.me nsztm1.digi.ninja
With this command we can able to get zone information from the particular dns server.
zone information includes subdomains


Nslookup & Dig command:

nslookup google.com
The above command gives us the basic information about the domain.
Information inlcudes server ip, domain ip .

nslookup -query=mx google.com
The above command gives us the mail exchange server information.
Information inlcudes ns, mx , aaa records.

dig google.com
The above command gives us the basic information about the domain.

dig axfr @nsztml.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
The above command gives us the the zone information.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnsenum google.com
The above command will help you get dns servers and subdomains

Amass:
It is a network mapping and attack surface discovery tool.
It will search in almost every search engines and get us the subdomains.
dev, testing these kind of subdomains have interesting info.

Nmap:
nmap is a network scanner.
It is used to scan a network, banner grabbing, version and os detection, port scanning etc..
-sC flag scan using default scripts.
nmap -sC -sV -A <ip-addr>
Nmap scripts:
these scripts are used to scan for specific vulnerabilities or even we can write our own scripts.


Nikto:
It is software vulnerability scanner.
Both nmap and nikto is too noisy which means it send lots of requests, so use vpn.
nikto -h <ip-addr> -p <port>

gobuster:
It is a tool used to fuzz directories and files in a website.

Dirbuster & Dirb:
It is a tool used to fuzz or bruteforce directories and files in a website.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMB Enumeration:
SMB stands for Server Message Block.
It is widely used in windows systems.
It is a protocol used to share files over network.
ports 139 and 445 are the smb ports.

nmap -p 139,445 -sV --script=smb-enum-shares <ip-addr>
The above command scans, checks if there is file sharing happening.
command Output:
smb-enum-shares: 
|   account_used: <blank>

if account used is blank, then anonymous login is allowed.

smbclient -L <ip-addr>
THe above cmd will list all the smb shares

\\192.168.29.186\print$:
 print$ is generally used for printers.

nbtscan <ip-addr>
The above command tells us the name of the machine.

There are tools to connect to this smb shares.
Those tools are smbmap and smbclient.

smbmap -H <ip-addr>
If you don't give user and pass, then it will consider it as anonymous login

smbclient -L //<ip-addr> --option="client min protocol=NT1"
Don't enter any password.
You will be logged in as anonymous user

smbclient -L //<ip-addr>/<dir> --option="client min protocol=NT1"
To get into the smb directory.
Eg:
smbclient -L //192.168.29.186/tmp --option="client min protocol=NT1"

smbclient \\\\10.129.139.62\\WorkShares
Use this to access Specific shares. WorkSHares can be accessed without password in our scenario.

Use get command to download files from smb.

enum4linux:
This tool do every possible enumeration for smb server
enum4linux -a 192.168.29.186
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nmap -p 1000-9999 -T5 10.129.8.71
-T5 boost your scan speed.
